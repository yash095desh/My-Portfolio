              I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in full
              stack development (React.js & Node.js). I am very enthusiastic
              about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital
              products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and
              writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters to me.
            </p>

              I began my journey as a web developer in 2022, and since then,
              I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new
              challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way.
              Now, at 19 years old, I'm building cutting-edge web applications
              using modern technologies such as the MERN stack, Next.js, and
              much more.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products
              end to end, from ideation all the way to development.
            </p>
            <p>
              One last thing, I'm available for freelance work, so feel free to
              reach out and say hello! I promise I don't bite ðŸ˜‰
